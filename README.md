# New_UPBEAT

This project is a recreation of my Object-Oriented Programming assignment from my second year. After two years of learning and practice, I aim to rebuild it with cleaner code, better design patterns, and stronger OOP principles. It serves as both a self-evaluation and proof of my growth as a programmer.
